\section{Introduction}
	
	This document defines the Software Requirements Specification and Technology Neutral Process Design for COS 301 Team Alpha. The Computer Science Department has expressed a need for the creation of a system, which can allow researchers to keep track of publications which they are currently working on, or have already published.
	\\
	The aim of this project is to follow a structured software development process in order to produce a product which provides the client with all the required functionality in an elegantly designed and built product. A collaborative and co-operative approach is required between all stakeholders who are involved in this project. 
	\\
	The information, specifications, and diagrams within this document are presented in order to provide testable requirements which correlate to the client's needs.
	
\section{Vision}
	The client for this project, Ms. Vreda Pieterse who is a member of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria, has solicited us to develop a system. The purpose of this system is to record and oversee all publications of staff members or research groups, within the Department of Computer Science. The system will assist the Head of Department to track the progress on any papers which are in the process of being written; as well as determining whether or not a staff member is under performing thus allowing the Head of Department the opportunity to provide advice to these staff members.
	
\section{Background}
    \subsection{The client's problem}
    	The client has solicited us to develop a system that has specific usability goals, as well as certain user-experience goals. Currently, the Department of Computer Science does not have a system with which to monitor the progress of staff member's publications, nor to keep track of how many publications an author is working on. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine which publications will be presented at different conferences, as well as the reporting capabilities, and the ability to remind users of deadlines. The system should provide all these requirements in a secure, flexible and intuitive manner.
   
	
\subsection{Future business/research opportunities}
	It is desired that this system will encourage authors to collaborate with other authors on similar topics and to expand the users base knowledge of ongoing research projects.

\section{Software Architecture Documentation}
    
    This document defines 
    
    \subsection{Architecture requirements}
        In this section extract the architectural requirements from the software requirements, including:

    \subsubsection{Architectural Scope}
        Architectural responsibilities that need to be addressed by the software architecture are as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Providing a persistent infrastructure - being a database stored on a dedicated server
            \item Providing a reporting infrastructure
            \item Providing an infrastructure for process execution
            \item Providing a backup infrastructure (e.g. making use of RAID)
            \item Providing a user interface through which the user can interact with the website/app
            \item Providing a means of Session management
            \item Providing a method of prevention against SQL injections
            \item Provide a log in system
            \item Provide a means with which to query the database in an interactive way
            \item Provide a means by which users can be notified about reminders
        \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{Quality requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
		    \item Performance \\\\
		        The performance of a system refers to the behaviour of the system in terms of repsonse time and throughput. Changes and modifications to the system should be done in the most cost and time effective manner to provide a good user experience.
		        One method of ensuring the performance is visible to the user is to make use of feedback tools to ensure the user is aware that the system is performing as expected or to notify the users should something have gone wrong.  
		    \item Security \\\\
		        Minimising the possibility of leaking information, maintaining data integrity, and avoiding session hijacking. This is very important as personal information will be stored in the database(e.g. email). The system will also have different user types with different access permissions hence security will be needed to ensure that a specific user only has the capabilities afforded to them. 
		        \\\\
		        We will achieve security by making use of 3 methods, namely: prevention, detection, and recovery.
		        We will ensure that we have put means in place through which we may be able to detect any threats to the system, for example validating any information that is required to be sent to the server. Preventing threats to the system can be enforced through limiting the access channels, making use of authentication, not allowing any external sources to be accessed through the system, etc. Recovery will be achieved through cancelling requests and maintaining a working back up state to reroll changes.
		    \item Maintainability \\\\
		        This refers to how well the system can be modified to accommodate new functionality, access channels, fix bugs and improve the performance of the system. As it is likely that multiple people will be working on the system the code has to be easy to read and understand. We will achieve this by commenting our code to allow for a quick study of the code. We will employ a means by which to allow pluggability of our code to ensure that large amounts of code will not be needed to be changed/removed.
		        \\\\
		        The system should not only be maintainable in terms of issues with the system but it should also be maintainable in terms of usability, i.e user permissions should be allowed to be changed, etc.
		        
		    \item Scalability \\\\
		        Scalabilty refers to the system's ability to handle increased traffic or workload. This will be implemented by ensuring that users can make the same requests simultaneously.
		        \\\\
		        We will need to ensure that resources are managed wisely in order to avoid lost updates, uncommitted data and inconsistent retrievals.
		
			    \item Reliability \\\\
		        As the system is required to support a fairly large user base it should allow for effective and safe concurrent use of the system. The system should ensure that no users can perform tasks that their user type does not afford to them.
		        \\\\
		        As access channels are via a web browser/android app it is essential that these access channels always have access to the server and thus database and ensure that the connection is stable, reliable and safe at all times. The system should be maintained in order to ensure that the system can perform all the required tasks in an effective and efficient manner. We will achieve this through unit testing, making use of concurrent resource locks and eliminating single points of failure.
			    \item Auditability\\\\
		        A requirement of the system is that all actions or changes to the should be logged to enable users with the appropriate permissions to be able to view all actions or changes to the system, who they were made by and when. This is essential in ensuring that the system can be rolled back to a stable state should something undesirable happen.
		        \\\\
		        We will implement this by having a log file running at all times which makes use of timestamping to indicate when changes were made, the system should allow to be rolled back to a stable state should it be deemed neccessary. ACID Properties will be applied to ensure that the database maintains a stable, reliable and current state.
		        
		        
		    \item Integrability \\\\
		        Will the system be able to integrate with other technologies.
		    \item Usability \\\\
		        Usability will be achieved through the implementation of an intuitive, easy to use, easy to understand and an aesthetically appealing interface through which the user will be able to perform all system functionality afforded to them through their user type.
		        \\\\
		        We will ensure that the user interface performs all tasks in the most efficient and direct means. The interface should not cause the user any irritation in the form of colour schemes, delayed functionality, over complication of tasks.
		 \end{itemize}
	

\subsection{Integration and access channel requirements}
    The CS Research System will serve as the basis of the entire system, possibly integrating with future systems. Integration can be made possible through the use of a RESTful API to enable cross-platform concurrent communication through HTTP or HTTPS. By using a service-oriented architecture and thereby componentizing the system, other systems can more easily integrate through service calls to these different components. A web interface as well as a mobile application, specifically on Android, should be made available for the end users. Other platforms should then be able to communicate with the system through simple REST API calls. Additionally, services such as Google Calendar and Google Mail can also be integrated into the system through simple API calls made available by Google. 
\\
    
\subsubsection{Architectural constraints}
   It is desired that this system will encourage authors to collaborate with other authors on similar topics and to expand the users base knowledge of ongoing research projects.

\section{Architectural patterns or styles}

\section{Architectural tactics or strategies}
In this section, we will discuss certain strategies that will be used to achieve the quality requirements stated in section 4.2 and were further expanded upon in section 5.1.2.
\begin{itemize}
	
	
	\item Hashing and Salting Passwords \\\\
	To ensure that sensitive information of the users of the system is not leaked in the event of a database compromise, all passwords will not be stored in plain text. Instead, all passwords will be hashed with a strong one-way hashing algorithm, such as the sha256, so that in the event of a database compromise, it will be near impossible to compute the actual passwords from the hashes. To make the hashes more effective, we will add random data, known as salt, to the passwords before hashing them. This will make it extremely difficult for intruders to use pre-hashed tables to perform a look up to find a matching password.
	\\
	\item Prepared Statements \\\\
	To prevent the illegal extraction of data and/or the destruction of data from the database through SQL injection and blind SQL injection attacks, we will make use of prepared statements. Prepared statements also have other benefits other than security. Even though prepared statements execute a statement multiple time, they reduce parsing time as the preparation of the query is only done once. This will improve the efficiency and performance of the system. Also, because prepared statements bind values to parameters, the bandwidth on the server is minimized because you only need to send the parameters to the server and not the whole query. This also improves the performance of the system.
	\\
	\item Caching \\\\
	Because the system relies heavenly on databases, there will be a significant number of access attempts to the the databases. This has the potential of creating a bottleneck that gets worse as the number of concurrent users increases. This means that the system will scale poorly and the performance of the system will decrease drastically. The best way to combat this is to limit accesses to the databases were possible. To accomplish this, we will make use of a distributed cache system. A distributed cache will particularly be effective in read operations and will provide large performance gains as it reduces the processing times of applications and it limits database accesses. This will improve the scalability of the system drastically and thus will accommodate a large number of concurrent users. 
	\\
	\item Database Normalization \\\\
	To make the system flexible, we will create the database tables and link them to one another were it is appropriate to do so according to rules that protect the data and makes it flexible. This process is known as normalization. Normalization eliminates redundancies and inconsistent dependencies. This makes it simple to makes changes to the system and also makes it easy to add new components to the system.
	\\
\end{itemize}
\section{Use of reference architectures and frameworks}
\section{Access and integration channels}
 Specify and quantify each of the quality requirements which are relevant to the system

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The different Web protocols used.
            \item API - UML Interfaces.
            \item Google Calender and Email integration.
            \item Mobile Scalability and functionality Integration.
            \item Venue and Publication integration.
            \\
        \end{itemize}

    

\section{Technologies}
    The following technologies will be used to develop the Research System:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. This will be the interface for the users of the system. 
        \item AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. The use of Ajax will bring dynamic changes to the web page. This will update changes to the system without the user having to refresh the page and will avoid identical information being submitted multiple times by multiple users. 
        \item JavaEE (Java Platform Enterprise Edition): This platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software, including network and web services, and other large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications. JavaEE is fundamental for the Research System in providing the connections for the user to the system.
        \item JavaScript (Functionality to HTML): An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. This will enhance the functionality and appearance of the web pages of the Research System.
        \item PHP (Server Side Scripting): PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. The Research System will use PHP for collecting data from forms, such as adding a user and adding a publication. 
        \item MySQL (Database Manager): MySQL is a database system used on the web, which runs on the server. This will be the chosen database system, since it is very fast, reliable, and easy to use, as well as being able to compile on a number of platforms.
        \item Android (Mobile Devices): Android is a mobile operating system, which is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. An android application will be developed for the Research System, to provide an easy to use interface for the user on mobile devices.
        \item Apache (Web Server): The Apache HTTP Server is the world's most used web server software. This is the chosen its performance and reliability, as well as being able to support the other technologies that the Research System will be using. 
        \item Linux/Windows/Mac (Operating System): The three operating systems that are most commonly used today. The Research System will have to be able to run in these three Operating Systems.
