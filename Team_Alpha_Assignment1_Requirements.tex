\section{Introduction}
This document defines the Software Requirements Specification and Technology Neutral Process Design for the COS 301 group. The Computer Science Department has expressed a need for the creation of a system, a system which can allow researchers to keep track of there publications that they are currently working on or have already published.

The aim of this project is to follow a structured software development process in order to produce a product that provides the client with all the functionality they requested in an elegantly coded product. This project requires a collaborative and co-operative approach between all stakeholders who are involved in this project. 

The information, specifications and diagrams within this document are presented in order to provide testable requirements which correlate to the client's specifications.

\section{Vision}
The client for this project, Vreda Pieterse who belongs to the Department of Computer Science of the University of Pretoria has solicited us to develop a system for them. The purpose of this system is to record and oversee all publications that any staff members or research group, within the Department of Computer Science, are working on. The system will help the Head of Department track and advise staff members' progress on any papers which are in the process of being written; as well as determining whether or not a staff member is under performing.

\section{Background}
\subsection{The client's problem}
The client has solicited us to develop a system that is has specific usability goals as well as certain user experience goals. Currently the Department of Computer Science do not have a system with which to monitor the progress of staff member's publications, track how many publications an author is working on, determine which publications will be presented at different conferences, have reporting capabilities, the ability to remind users of deadlines among other things. The system should allow for all these requirements in a secure, flexible and auditable manner.

\subsection{Future business opportunities}
A possible desire for this project is to encourage authors to collaborate with other authors on similar topics and to expand the user base knowledge of ongoing research projects.
