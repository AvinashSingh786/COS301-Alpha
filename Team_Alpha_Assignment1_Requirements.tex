	\section{Introduction}
	
	This document defines the Software Requirements Specification and Technology Neutral Process Design for the COS 301 group. The Computer Science Department has expressed a need for the creation of a system, which can allow researchers to keep track of publications which they are currently working on, or have already published.
	\\
	The aim of this project is to follow a structured software development process in order to produce a product which provides the client with all the functionality requested in an elegantly coded product. A collaborative and co-operative approach is required between all stakeholders who are involved in this project. 
	\\
	The information, specifications, and diagrams within this document are presented in order to provide testable requirements which correlate to the client's needs.
	
	\section{Vision}
	The client for this project, Ms. Vreda Pieterse, who belongs to the Department of Computer Science, at the University of Pretoria, has solicited us to develop a system. The purpose of this system is to record and oversee all publications of staff members or research groups, within the Department of Computer Science. The system will assist the Head of Department to track and advise staff members' progress on any papers which are in the process of being written; as well as determining whether or not a staff member is under performing.
	
	\section{Background}
	\subsection{The client's problem}
	The client has solicited us to develop a system that has specific usability goals, as well as certain user-experience goals. Currently, the Department of Computer Science does not have a system with which to monitor the progress of staff member's publications, nor to keep track of how many publications an author is working on. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine which publications will be presented at different conferences, as well as the reporting capabilities, and the ability to remind users of deadlines. The system should allow for all these requirements in a secure, flexible and intuitive manner.
	
	\subsection{Future business opportunities}
	A desire for this project is to encourage authors to collaborate with other authors on similar topics and to expand the users base knowledge of ongoing research projects.
	\\
	\\
	\\
	
	
	\section{Architecture Requirements}
	This section will be expanded on and developed further in the next phase of the project design and will be mentioned only briefly here.
	\\
	\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}
	It is possible that there can be many concurrent users using the system so it is optimal that there be such interfaces such as a web application or website, as well as a mobile platform applications for the various different mobile devices.
	\\
	\subsection{Quality Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performance - How well the system can cope with extreme load.
		\item Security - Can the system leak information, data integrity, session hijack.
		\item Maintainability - Can the system be managed without downtime.
		\item Scalability - Can the system be used for large amount of users plus can it provide the services needed.
		\item Efficiency - Can the system be optimized to produce faster and better results
		\item Flexibility - Can the system be easily changed or modified.
		\item Reliability - Is the system able to cope with the load and provide constant access and is always active.
		\item Integrability - Can it integrate with Google to send reminders.
		\item User Friendly - Does a user understand how to use the system, is it easily usable.
		\item Concurrency - Can multiple users perform actions at the same time.
		\item Low Cost, Reduced data usage - Is it suitable for users with low budget and capped Internet.
		\item Updatability - Can the system have version updates to introduce new features or functionality.
		\\
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Integration Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The different Web protocols used 
		\item API - UML Interfaces
