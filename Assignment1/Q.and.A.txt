Hi Guys

Here is just some clarifications on the project.

Definitions:
	1. Venue: The physical place where the Publication gets published
	2. Type of Venue: This is the type of Publication, for example, is it a Conference Paper, a Journal or Technical Report?

Questions that were asked and answers to them:
	Q. Does a Publication always have to have a Conference where it is published?
	A. Yes. It will alwayshave a Type of Venue, that is either a Conference Event Name, or a Journal Name or the Name of the Instition.
	
	Q. Do all users belong to a research group?
	A. Yes, all users belong to at least one group.
	
	Q. What happens if a conference is cancelled?
	A. Status of the Publication goes from accepted/in review/submitted to terminated and then another Publication with the same name and description can be opened if you want to submit it to another conference/journal
	
	Q. Server provided?
	A. Vreda says that is an architechtural(?) concern, not something we need to be worried in the requirement phase.
	
If anyone has any questions about anything, please post them here and then we whoever gets a chance can ask the lecturers and post the answers
